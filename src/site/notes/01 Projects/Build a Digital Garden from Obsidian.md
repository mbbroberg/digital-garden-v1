### Active: Plugin-based 
What would help me rule it as go/no go? 
- Try to add at least 3 interlinked notes... let's say on a topic from my KB 
- 

The config: 
- https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/03-note-settings/
- https://vercel.com/mbbrobergs-projects/mentalmoss
- https://mossymentalmodel.vercel.app

### Structure 
#### Mine 

PARA > I could straight up share that as is — Projects / Areas (maintained) / Resources (snippets of thought) / Archive (no longer relevant to me)

Why avoid the structure I’ve put around my own thoughts? 
- I feel it’s *too complicated* — no, I am worried to be judged and reflection reminds me not to care 

#### Reuse some of Jacky’s? 

His only folders 
- thoughts 
- writing 

title: "Sapling"
description: "Saplings are single nodes or thoughts. These are generally topics I've spent a decent number of hours thinking about and contain substantial original thought."

title: "Seed"
description: "I tend to generally bookmark things for later then revisit them when I have time. These are collections of notes on articles, books, and readings. They are the seeds that form the basis of my ideas and thoughts."

title: "Pattern"
description: "A pattern in my own pattern language. These represent atomic concepts and observations that appear and reappear within my thinking and work. See the note on 'A Pattern Language' for more information"

title: "Personal"
description: "Personal reflections and musings about my life. I really like to write feelings down as a way to process them and sometimes they take the form of blogposts like these."

For me it’s 
- seed
- sprout 
- verdant 


### Researching Quartz 
https://jzhao.xyz, building of [[Philosophy of Quartz\|Philosophy of Quartz]]
- Into Deleuze clearly! Writes about rhizomes 

Pros
- Beautiful out of the box 
- Philosophically congruent with me 
Cons
- Not native — gotta figure out a workflow to go from Obsidian to Quartz repo
- Not obvious — an hour of tinkering got something going, but I have questions

### Researching Mkdocs
https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#markdown_extensions

Because my intro to this whole concept comes form https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/

Seems sysadmin and less stylish than the others… 

### Researching Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin 
Got it up and running 2024-05-04 

Pros
- Great integration into Obsidian proper
- Simple enough hosting configuration with GitHub and Vercel 
- Will render dataview results, which is nice for my heavy use of them
Cons
- Don't love the templates, so I risk spending all my time tweaking instead of gardening
- Specifically: 
	- No dark/light toggle button 
	- Layout online and mobile is wonky
	- No navigation bar option?

Conclusion — I’m too into form as function to accept this solution as is... continue to explore themes via the community
